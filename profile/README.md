Welcome to our repository. Here you can see the capstone project that we developed, namely a health application to conduct an initial screening of the potential risk of diabetes. You can also find various information on preventing and managing diabetes and get recommendations for diabetes-friendly diary products. You can also set reminders to perform routine detections here, you can do all of this with the "Insul.in" application.

## Our API's
In this project we developed an API to present data on diabetes articles, recommended products that we recommend and the results of diabetes detection that users do. Here is a sample API we use
| Purposes | Technology | visibility | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| Article Data | Firebase Realtime Database | 🔓 public | https://insul-in-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/article.json |
| Recommendation Product Data | Firebase Realtime Database |  🔓 public | https://insul-in-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/affiliation_product.json |
| Diabetes Detection | Flask | 🔒 private | https://prediction-api-dot-capstone-project-349802.et.r.appspot.com |
